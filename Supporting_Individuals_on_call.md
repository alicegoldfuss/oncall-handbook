# Supporting Individuals on call
Thank you for interest in supporting your fellow infrastructure warriors.

Providing support to your on call staff has a major positive impact to the individual on call creating a happy, dedicated, and proud on call employee. In turn, you will get better, faster, and helpful service.  

## Providing Support
As you can see, supporting the on call worker is important for all involved. Here are some tips to provide support:
* Be extra nice and kind - The on call individual may be overly stressed, tired, and drained of normal will power to do tasks due to plethora of reasons. If they have an attitude, provide an acceptable amount of slack and respect. Kindness does indeed go a long way.
* Do NOT submit non-critical cases that are not business impacting. Verify you have reviewed all materials, information, and resources _before_ submitting a critical case to the on call engineer.
* Be patient - the on call individual may be addressing and researching basic items before reaching out. Likewise, know your escalation options if an appropriate period has been reached.
* Consider providing positive, constructive feedback if your Human Resources department offers this resource for on-call work that is above and beyond. If this system does not exist, consider a hand written note. On-call, at points, may be a non-appreciative experience.

### Background of on-call experience
In order to understand a topic, it is often helpful to get some background on the experience. This section hopes to address the background of an on call engineer.

On call can be tough, stressful, and busy. A typical on call shift can be quiet or insane. Indeed, the sporadic nature of work makes an on call schedule only fit a certain mentality. On call is not the same as working a large amount of hours. It can be argued that on call is tougher than an increased standard hour work week. As a friend of mine in the IT industry put it,
> I would rather work 50 hours a week then a 40 hour work week even if I knew in advance that only 30 minutes of it would be on call

On call work hours are _hard hours_. The reasons vary but a few include:
* Inability to plan basic events with friends, family, and oneself
* Interrupted events such as dinner, sleep, or even your favorite TV episode
* Social stressors such as having to monitor your mobile device or waking up house mates from on call obligations

The easiest way to demonstrate on call life is with a short example. Pretend, for a moment, you are on call. You receive an invite to go to the movies with a friend you have not seen in 7 years. At that same moment, you receive a critical on call alert. Due to your on call job duties, you will need to skip out on the movie adventure. In the off chance you were able to attend the movie, you would still need to determine a method to monitor and perform on call obligations.
