# The On-Call Handbook

Is this your first time on-call? Or, perhaps not your first rodeo, but you want to see what others are doing with theirs? You're in the right place.

While on-call shouldn't be a soul-destroying experience, some rotations are heavier than others, and there are things you can do to make your life easier.

This is a collection of tips and tricks to get you through your rotation from people who have been there.

I. [Pager Setup](pager_setup.md)

II. [On-call Kit](on_call_kit.md)

III. [General Prep](general_prep.md)

IV. [Optimizing Rotations](optimizing_rotations.md)

V. [Relaxation](relaxation.md)

Pull requests gladly accepted.
