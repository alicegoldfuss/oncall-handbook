# The On-Call Handbook

Is this your first time on-call? Or, perhaps not your first rodeo, but you want to see what others are doing with theirs? You're in the right place.

While on-call shouldn't be a soul-destroying experience, some rotations are heavier than others, and there are things you can do to make your life easier.

This is a collection of tips and tricks to get you through your rotation from people who have been there.
