# Computer Setup

General setup for your laptop and related equipment.

1. Be prepared to take your laptop with you wherever you go. Invest in a comfortable bag with ergonomic straps. If you drive most places consider getting a laptop sleeve and put your laptop in the sleeve in the map pocket behind your seat.
2. Bring a laptop and phone charger with you.
3. If you have a mifi (recommended), set it up on your laptop before you actually need to use it.
4. Make sure you have access to all the necessary VPNs, password trackers, and related systems.
5. Install [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/). It's worth it for those 3 am pages.
