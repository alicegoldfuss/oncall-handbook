# Creamy Italian Sausage Soup

This is a solid, creamier soup for those who like their soups rich and creamy. 

The recipe makes a huge batch - while this recommends a Dutch oven, a regular soup pot will work just fine. I don't recommend a slow cooker for this, as the sausage gets a bit nasty.

## Ingredients

2 lbs bulk mild Italian sausage

1 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional - don't include if you don't like heat)

5 slices thick cut bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces

1 large onion, diced

2 cloves minced garlic

10 cups chicken broth

2.5 - 3 lbs potatoes, thinly sliced (I used Yukon golds)

1 cup heavy cream

1/4 - 1/2 bunch of fresh kale, tough stems removed and torn into small pieces

## Directions

1. Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned and no longer pink.  Drain and set aside.
2. Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of the drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven.  
3. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent.
4. Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion mixture.  
5. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes.  
6. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the heavy cream and the cooked sausage, heat through.  
7. Mix the kale into the soup just before serving.

Enjoy!
