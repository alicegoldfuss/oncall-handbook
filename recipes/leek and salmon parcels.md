2 Servings

250gz leeks (about 3 small ones or 1 really big), thinly sliced
50g katiki cheeze ( subst other spicy creamy cheeze)
50g greek strained yogurt
1 tbsp chopped dill, plus 1 tsp
2 skinless salmon ﬁllets
1 lemon, grated zest of 1 / 2 , plus  
a good squeeze of juice
2-3 tsp capers

1. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.
Place two sheets of baking parchment (large enough to wrap up each salmon 
ﬁllet) on your work surface.
2. mix the cheeze with the yogurt till you get a homogenized consistency
3. Put the leeks in a pan with 6 tbspwater, cover and bring to the boil. Cook
for 5 mins until the water has been absorbed and the leeks are almost
tender. Stir in the cheeze/yogurt mix, 1 tbsp dill and some seasoning.
Leave alone for 2 minutes for the flavors to mix

4. Spoon half the creamy leeks into the middle of one sheet of parchment and
place a salmon ﬁllet on top, repeat for 2nd parcel.
Sprinkle over the lemon zest with a squeeze of juice, then scatter over the
capers and the remaining 1 tsp dill.

4 Bring the parchment up over the ﬁsh and join the two edges together by
folding them over several times, ditto from the ends, we want this to be 
largely enclosed so the salmon will be steamed in the juices of the leek/cheeze mix
Place the parcels, spaced apart, on a baking sheet.

5 Bake for 12-15 mins, depending on how well done you like your ﬁsh, then
carefully tear open the parcel. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing
over, goes well with mashed potatoes....
