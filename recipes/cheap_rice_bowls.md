# Rice Bowls

Rice is an amazing thing - it's cheap, it's filling, and you can add a lot of delicious stuff to it. This receipe is one that I make as a busy weekday favorite. If you have a rice cooker, it's unbelievably easy; if you don't, cooking rice in a simple pot is also good. Here's my [favorite way to make rice in a pot](http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/cooking-tips/article/how-to-make-white-rice-effed-it-up).

This recipe is adapted from this one by Budget Bytes. I also recommend using white quinoa instead of rice for more protein (prep is very similar), adding chicken, pineapple, chickpeas or jalapenos if you like some spice. If you need to clean veggies out of your fridge, this is a good recipe to do it.

## Ingredients

*makes four bowls*

1 cup uncooked rice (will likely make around 3 cups cooked rice)

1 14oz can black beans

2 handfulls of shredded cheese (cheddar or pepper jack)

1 bunch green onions $0.75

¼ cup salsa

1 avocado, sliced

¼ tsp garlic powder

Salt & pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Cook the rice: Add water to your pot. If using brown rice, add about 15-20 min to your cook time.
2. While rice is cooking, pit your avocado and chop into long, thin strips. If you're adding any additional vegetables, dice them into smaller chunks. Shred your cheese, if not pre-shredded.
3. When rice is almost done cooking, empty your can of beans into a saucepan and cook briefly over medium heat - enough to warm the beans, but not change their state. Heat along with the garlic powder, and salt to taste (if needed)
4. Once the rice is cooked, build the bowls. Begin with one cup cooked rice, ⅓ cup warm black beans, ⅓ cup salsa, and 1 oz. shredded cheese (about ¼ cup). Top with a few sliced green onions and serve.
5. Enjoy!
