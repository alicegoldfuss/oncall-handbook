# Pager/Phone Setup

That thing you have to carry around now. This section assumes you are using a cell phone and Pagerduty. Other setups welcome.

## Taking Phone Calls

1. Listen with your right ear. Studies have shown that this improves a "can-do" attitude.
2. If you find your self on conference calls for hours at a time, invest in a high-quality headset that will let you listen with both ears and keeps your hands free. Wireless models like the Logitech H800 keep you from feeling too anchored.

## iPhone

1. Setup your Pagerduty notifications to call you (repeatedly) and give Pagerduty its own unique ringtone. If you only rely on SMS or push notifications, you will constantly worry about missing them (or actually miss them) and your heart will race every time your phone pings.
2. Add Pagerduty's number (have it do a test call) to your Contacts list and add it as a Favorite.
3. In your iPhone's Settings, enable Do Not Disturb at night and Allow Calls From > Favorites. This way you can sleep soundly, knowing that if you get a phone call, it's either someone important (from your Favorites) or servers dying.

## Android
