# Pager Setup

That thing you have to carry around now. This section assumes you are using a cell phone and PagerDuty. Other setups welcome.

## Taking Calls
1. Listen with your right ear. Studies have shown that this [improves a "can-do" attitude](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090623090705.htm).
2. If you find your self on conference calls for hours at a time, invest in a high-quality headset that will let you listen with both ears and keeps your hands free. Wireless models like the Logitech H800 keep you from feeling too anchored.

## iPhone

1. Add Pagerduty's number (have it do a test call) to your Contacts list and add it as a Favorite. PagerDuty provides [all their numbers and an updated vCard](https://support.pagerduty.com/hc/en-us/articles/202828870-Phone-numbers-notifications-are-sent-from) that you can add to your Contacts.
2. In your iPhone's Settings, enable Do Not Disturb at night and Allow Calls From > Favorites. This way you can sleep soundly, knowing that if you get a phone call, it's either someone important (from your Favorites) or servers dying.

## Android

1. Starting with Android Marshmallow, you can enable Do Not Disturb in "Priority Only" mode to only allow notifications from contacts you specify.
2. In addition to DND mode (or as an alternative, for pre-Marshmallow phones), you can also use [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/index.html) to customize notifications: for example, when certain numbers call or text, use Tasker to raise the volume to max (good for heavy sleepers!). There are many ways to do this, but [here is one example](http://www.androidauthority.com/tasker-emergency-calls-399762/)

## All

1. Setup your PagerDuty notifications to call you (repeatedly) and give Pagerduty its own unique ringtone. If you only rely on SMS or push notifications, you will constantly worry about missing them (or actually miss them) and your heart will race every time your phone pings. PagerDuty is highly customizable, and a combination of SMS, push, and phone calls is recommended.
2. Set your PagerDuty push alert sounds and ringtone to be something highly distinct from your regular ringtone, and avoid commonly used or OS-native sounds: this well help avoid confusing a stranger's SMS tone in public with your own on-call notifications.
3. Make sure your phone is not silenced.
