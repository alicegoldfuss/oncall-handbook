# A Glossary of Terms

#### Escalation
Many on-call policies have multiple tiers. An *escalation* is when a call-out
is passed to the next tier. This may happen deliberately, or by policy.

#### Network Operations Center
Also known as a NOC, these are often staffed 24/7. Implementations vary by organization,
but these often take the place of first-line on-call. Employees in the NOC are often
shift-workers. Typically found in either old organizations where the NOC is a remnant of
the old 'machine room' days, or large organizations that can afford the coverage costs.

#### Post-mortem
A process to answer a few basic questions:
* What went wrong?
* Why did it do that?
* What can we do to make it not do that again?
* How can we detect this better in the future?

#### Overrides
A term used in on-call scheduling software to describe the process of shift-swapping,
or applying a small change to a schedule. If someone needs to take the pager for
4 hours of a 36 hour shift, this is accomplished through an override in the software.

#### Shift swapping
Exchanging shifts with another employee. This is often done through negotiations, especially
near holidays and summer vacation season. See also, Overrides.
